I'm Sending You A Big Bouquet Of Roses
One For Every Time You Broke My Heart
And As The Door Of Love Between Us Closes
Tears Will Fall Like Petals When We Part
I Begged You To Be Different, But You'll Always Be Untrue
I'm Tired Of Forgivin', Now There's Nothin' Left To Do
So I'm Sending You A Big Bouquet Of Roses
One For Every Time You Broke My Heart
I Know That I Should Hate You After All You've Put Me Through
But How Can I Be Bitter When I'm Still In Love With You?
So I'm Sending You A Big Bouquet Of Roses
One For Every Time You Broke My Heart
