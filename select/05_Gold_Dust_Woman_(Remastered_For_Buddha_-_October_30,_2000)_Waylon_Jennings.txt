Rock on gold dust woman,
Take your silver spoon and dig your grave
Heartless challenge,
Pick your path and I'll pray.

Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise lovers do go down
Lousy lovers pick their pray
But they'll never cry out loud.

Well, did he make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now do you know how
To pick up the pieces and go home?

Rock on ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your knigdom up for sale.

Well, did he make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now do you know how
To pick up the pieces and go home?

Did he make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now do you know how
To pick up the pieces and go home?...
